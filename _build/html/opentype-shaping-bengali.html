<h2>General information<a class="headerlink" href="#general-information" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Bengali or Bangla script belongs to the Indic family, and follows
the same general patterns as the other Indic scripts. More
specifically, it belongs to the North Indic subgroup, in which
sequences of adjacent consonants are often represented as conjuncts.</p>
<p>The Bengali script is used to write multiple languages, most commonly
Bengali, Assamese, and Manipuri. In addition, Sanskrit may be written
in Bengali, so Bengali script runs may include glyphs from the Vedic
Extensions block of Unicode.</p>
<p>There are two extant Bengali script tags defined in OpenType, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;beng&gt;</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;bng2&gt;</span></code>. The older script tag, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;beng&gt;</span></code>, was deprecated in 2005.
Therefore, new fonts should be engineered to work with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;bng2&gt;</span></code>
shaping model. However, if a font is encountered that supports only
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;beng&gt;</span></code>, the shaping engine should deal with it gracefully.</p>
</section>
<section id="terminology">
<h2>Terminology<a class="headerlink" href="#terminology" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenType shaping uses a standard set of terms for Indic scripts.  The
terms used colloquially in any particular language may vary, however,
potentially causing confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Matra</strong> is the standard term for a dependent vowel sign. In the Bengali
language, dependent-vowel signs  may also be referred to as <em>kar</em> forms — e.g., “i-kar” or
“u-kar”.</p>
<p>The term “matra” is also used to refer to the headline above most
Bengali letters. To avoid ambiguity, the term <strong>headline</strong> is
used in most Unicode and OpenType shaping documents.</p>
<p><strong>Halant</strong> and <strong>Virama</strong> are both standard terms for the below-base “vowel-killer”
mark. Unicode documents use the term “virama” most frequently, while
OpenType documents use the term “halant” most frequently. In the Bengali
language, this sign is known as the <em>hasanta</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chandrabindu</strong> (or simply <strong>Bindu</strong>) is the standard term for the diacritical mark
indicating that the preceding vowel should be nasalized. In the Bengali
language, this mark is known as the <em>candrabindu</em>.</p>
<p>The term <strong>base consonant</strong> is also critical to Indic shaping. The
base consonant of a syllable is the consonant that carries the
syllable’s vowel sound, either the inherent vowel (for an unmarked
base consonant) or a dependent vowel (with the addition of a matra).</p>
<p>A syllable’s base consonant is generally rendered in its full form
(although it may form ligatures), while other consonants in the
syllable frequently take on secondary forms. Different GSUB
substitutions may apply to a script’s <strong>pre-base</strong> and <strong>post-base</strong>
consonants. Some of these substitutions create <strong>above-base</strong> or
<strong>below-base</strong> forms. The <strong>Reph</strong> form of the consonant “Ra” is an
example.</p>
<p>Syllables may also begin with an <strong>independent vowel</strong> instead of a
consonant. In these syllables, the independent vowel is rendered in
full-letter form, not as a matra, and the independent vowel serves as the
syllable base, similar to a base consonant.</p>
<p>Where possible, using the standard terminology is preferred, as the
use of a language-specific term necessitates choosing one language
over all of the others that share a common script.</p>
</section>
<section id="glyph-classification">
<h2>Glyph classification<a class="headerlink" href="#glyph-classification" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Shaping Bengali text depends on the shaping engine correctly
classifying each glyph in the run. As with most other scripts, the
classifications must distinguish between consonants, vowels
(independent and dependent), numerals, punctuation, and various types
of diacritical mark.</p>
<p>For most codepoints, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">General</span> <span class="pre">Category</span></code> property defined in the Unicode
standard is correct, but it is not sufficient to fully capture the
expected shaping behavior (such as glyph reordering). Therefore,
Bengali glyphs must additionally be classified by how they are treated
when shaping a run of text.</p>
<section id="shaping-classes-and-subclasses">
<h3>Shaping classes and subclasses<a class="headerlink" href="#shaping-classes-and-subclasses" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The shaping classes listed in the tables that follow are defined so
that they capture the positioning rules used by Indic scripts.</p>
<p>For most codepoints, the <em>Shaping class</em> is synonymous with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Indic</span> <span class="pre">Syllabic</span> <span class="pre">Category</span></code> defined in Unicode. However, there are some
distinctions, where the defined category does not fully capture the
behavior of the character in the shaping process.</p>
<p>Several of the diacritic and syllable-modifying marks behave according
to their own rules and, thus, have a special class. These include
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BINDU</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VISARGA</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVAGRAHA</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NUKTA</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VIRAMA</span></code>. Some
less-common marks behave according to rules that are similar to these
common marks, and are therefore classified with the corresponding
common mark. The Vedic Extensions also include a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CANTILLATION</span></code>
class for tone marks.</p>
<p>Letters generally fall into the classes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CONSONANT</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VOWEL_INDEPENDENT</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VOWEL_DEPENDENT</span></code>. These classes help the
shaping engine parse and identify key positions in a syllable. For
example, Unicode categorizes dependent vowels as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mark</span> <span class="pre">[Mn]</span></code>, but the
shaping engine must be able to distinguish between dependent vowels
and diacritical marks (which are categorized as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mark</span> <span class="pre">[Mn]</span></code>).</p>
<p>Bengali uses one subclass of consonant, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CONSONANT_DEAD</span></code>. This
subclass is used only for the Bengali “Khanda Ta” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09CE</span></code>). It indicates that
“Khanda Ta” should match tests for consonants, such as when <a class="reference internal" href="#identifying-syllables-and-other-sequences"><span class="std std-doc">identifying
syllables</span></a>, but that, unlike
standard consonants, it carries no inherent vowel. The lack of an
inherent vowel is important during the <a class="reference internal" href="#initial-reordering"><span class="std std-doc">initial
reordering</span></a> stage.</p>
<p>Other characters, such as symbols and miscellaneous letters (for
example, letter-like symbols that only occur as standalone entities
and do not occur within syllables), need no special attention from the
shaping engine, so they are not assigned a shaping class.</p>
<p>Numbers are classified as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NUMBER</span></code>, even though they evoke no special
behavior from the Indic shaping rules, because there are OpenType features that
might affect how the respective glyphs are drawn, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tnum</span></code>,
which specifies the usage of tabular-width numerals, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sups</span></code>, which
replaces the default glyphs with superscript variants.</p>
<p>Marks and dependent vowels are further labeled with a mark-placement
subclass, which indicates where the glyph will be placed with respect
to the syllable base to which it is attached. The actual position of
the glyphs is determined by the lookups found in the font’s GPOS
table, however, the shaping rules for Indic scripts require that the
shaping engine be able to identify marks by their general
position.</p>
<p>For example, left-side dependent vowels (matras), classified
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LEFT_POSITION</span></code>, must frequently be reordered, with the final
position determined by whether or not other letters in the syllable
have formed ligatures or combined into conjunct forms. Therefore, the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LEFT_POSITION</span></code> subclass of the character must be tracked throughout
the shaping process.</p>
<p>There are four basic <em>mark-placement subclasses</em> for dependent vowels
(matras). Each corresponds to the visual position of the matra with
respect to the base consonant or syllable base to which it is attached:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LEFT_POSITION</span></code> matras are positioned to the left of the syllable base.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RIGHT_POSITION</span></code> matras are positioned to the right of the syllable base.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TOP_POSITION</span></code> matras are positioned above the syllable base.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BOTTOM_POSITION</span></code> matras are positioned below syllable base.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These positions may also be referred to elsewhere in shaping documents as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Pre-base</em> matras</p></li>
<li><p><em>Post-base</em> matras</p></li>
<li><p><em>Above-base</em> matras</p></li>
<li><p><em>Below-base</em> matras</p></li>
</ul>
<p>respectively. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LEFT</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RIGHT</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TOP</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BOTTOM</span></code> designations
corresponds to Unicode’s preferred terminology. The <em>Pre</em>, <em>Post</em>,
<em>Above</em>, and <em>Below</em> terminology is used in the official descriptions
of OpenType GSUB and GPOS features. Shaping engines may, internally,
use whichever terminology is preferred.</p>
<p>In addition, dependent-vowel codepoints that are composed of multiple
components will be designated in character tables as having a compound
<em>mark-placement subclass</em>, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TOP_AND_RIGHT</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LEFT_AND_RIGHT</span></code>.</p>
<p>However, these multi-part matras are decomposed into separate matra
components during the shaping process. After the decomposition, each
matra component will belong to exactly one of the four basic
<em>mark-placement subclasses</em>.</p>
<p>For most mark and dependent-vowel codepoints, the <em>mark-placement
subclass</em> is synonymous with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Indic</span> <span class="pre">Positional</span> <span class="pre">Category</span></code> defined
in Unicode. However, there are some distinctions, where the defined
category does not fully capture the behavior of the character in the
shaping process.</p>

<section id="bengali-character-tables">
<h3>Bengali character tables<a class="headerlink" href="#bengali-character-tables" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Separate character tables are provided for the Bengali and Vedic
Extensions blocks as well as for other miscellaneous characters that
are used in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;bng2&gt;</span></code> text runs:</p>
<ul class="simple">

</ul>
<p>The tables list each codepoint along with its Unicode general
category, its shaping class, and its mark-placement subclass. The
codepoint’s Unicode name and an example glyph are also provided.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">

</table>
<p>Codepoints with no assigned meaning are
designated as <em>unassigned</em> in the <em>Unicode category</em> column.</p>
<p>Assigned codepoints with a <em>null</em> in the <em>Shaping class</em>
column evoke no special behavior from the shaping engine.</p>
<p>The <em>Mark-placement subclass</em> column indicates mark-placement
positioning for codepoints in the <em>Mark</em> category. Assigned, non-mark
codepoints have a <em>null</em> in this column and evoke no special
mark-placement behavior. Marks tagged with [Mn] in the <em>Unicode
category</em> column are categorized as non-spacing; marks tagged with
[Mc] are categorized as spacing-combining.</p>
<p>Some codepoints in the tables use a <em>Shaping class</em> that
differs from the codepoint’s Unicode <em>General Category</em>. The <em>Shaping
class</em> takes precedence during OpenType shaping, as it captures more
specific, script-aware behavior.</p>
<section id="special-function-codepoints">
<h4>Special-function codepoints<a class="headerlink" href="#special-function-codepoints" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Other important characters that may be encountered when shaping runs
of Bengali text include the dotted-circle placeholder (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+25CC</span></code>), the
zero-width joiner (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+200D</span></code>) and zero-width non-joiner (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+200C</span></code>), and
the no-break space (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+00A0</span></code>).</p>
<p>Each of these is of particular importance to shaping engines, because
these codepoints interact with the shaping engine, the text run, and
the active font, either to mediate non-default shaping behavior or to
relay information about the current shaping process.</p>
<p>The dotted-circle placeholder is frequently used when displaying a
dependent vowel (matra) or a combining mark in isolation. Real-world
text syllables may also use other characters, such as hyphens or dashes,
in a similar placeholder fashion; shaping engines should cope with
this situation gracefully.</p>
<p>Dotted-circle placeholder characters (like any Unicode codepoint) can
appear anywhere in text input sequences and should be rendered
normally. GPOS positioning lookups should attach mark glyphs to dotted
circles as they would to other non-mark characters. As visible glyphs,
dotted circles can also be involved in GSUB substitutions.</p>
<p>In addition to the default input-text handling process, shaping
engines may also insert dotted-circle placeholders into the text
sequence. Dotted-circle insertions are required when a non-spacing
mark or dependent sign is formed with no base character present.</p>
<p>This requirement covers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dependent signs that are assigned their own individual Unicode
codepoints (such as most dependent-vowel marks or matras)</p></li>
<li><p>Dependent signs that are formed only by specific sequences of
other codepoints (such as “Reph”)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The zero-width joiner (ZWJ) is primarily used to prevent the formation
of a conjunct from a “<em>Consonant</em>,Halant,<em>Consonant</em>” sequence.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The sequence “<em>Consonant</em>,Halant,ZWJ,<em>Consonant</em>” blocks the
formation of a conjunct between the two consonants.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note, however, that the “<em>Consonant</em>,Halant” subsequence in the above
example may still trigger a half-forms feature. To prevent the
application of the half-forms feature in addition to preventing the
conjunct, the zero-width non-joiner (ZWNJ) must be used instead.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The sequence “<em>Consonant</em>,Halant,ZWNJ,<em>Consonant</em>” should produce
the first consonant in its standard form, followed by an explicit
“Halant”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A secondary usage of the zero-width joiner is to prevent the formation of
“Reph”.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An initial “Ra,Halant,ZWJ” sequence should not produce a “Reph”,
even where an initial “Ra,Halant” sequence without the zero-width
joiner would otherwise produce a “Reph”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ZWJ and ZWNJ characters are, by definition, non-printing control
characters and have the <em>Default_Ignorable</em> property in the Unicode
Character Database. In standard text-display scenarios, their function
is to signal a request from the user to the shaping engine for some
particular non-default behavior. As such, they are not rendered
visually.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: Naturally, there are special circumstances where a user or
document might need to request that a ZWJ or ZWNJ be rendered
visually, such as when illustrating the OpenType shaping process, or
displaying Unicode tables.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Because the ZWJ and ZWNJ are non-printing control characters, they can
be ignored by any portion of a software text-handling stack not
involved in the shaping operations that the ZWJ and ZWNJ are designed
to interface with. For example, spell-checking or collation functions
will typically ignore ZWJ and ZWNJ.</p>
<p>Similarly, the ZWJ and ZWNJ should be ignored by the shaping engine
when matching sequences of codepoints against the backtrack and
lookahead sequences of a font’s GSUB or GPOS lookups.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A lookup that substitutes an alternate version of a
dependent-vowel (matra) glyph when it is preceded by “Ka,Halant,Tta”
should still be applied if the dependent-vowel codepoint is preceded
by “Ka,Halant,ZWJ,Tta” in the text run.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The no-break space (NBSP) is primarily used to display those
codepoints that are defined as non-spacing (marks, dependent vowels
(matras), below-base consonant forms, and post-base consonant forms)
in an isolated context, as an alternative to displaying them
superimposed on the dotted-circle placeholder. These sequences will
match “NBSP,ZWJ,Halant,<em>Consonant</em>”, “NBSP,<em>mark</em>”, or “NBSP,<em>matra</em>”.</p>
<p>In addition to general punctuation, runs of Bengali text often use the
danda (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+0964</span></code>) and double danda (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+0965</span></code>) punctuation marks from
the Devanagari block.</p>

<h2>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;bng2&gt;</span></code> shaping model<a class="headerlink" href="#the-bng2-shaping-model" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Processing a run of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;bng2&gt;</span></code> text involves six top-level stages:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Identifying syllables and other sequences</p></li>
<li><p>Initial reordering</p></li>
<li><p>Applying the basic substitution features from GSUB</p></li>
<li><p>Final reordering</p></li>
<li><p>Applying all remaining substitution features from GSUB</p></li>
<li><p>Applying all remaining positioning features from GPOS</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As with other Indic scripts, the initial reordering stage and the
final reordering stage each involve applying a set of several
script-specific rules. The basic substitution features must be applied
to the run in a specific order. The remaining substitution features in
stage five, however, do not have a mandatory order.</p>
<p>Indic scripts follow many of the same shaping patterns, but they
differ in a few critical characteristics that the shaping engine must
track. These include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The position of the base consonant in a syllable.</p></li>
<li><p>The final position of “Reph”.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether “Reph” must be requested explicitly or if it is formed by
a specific, implicit sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether the below-base forms feature is applied only to consonants
before the syllable base, only to consonants after the base
consonant, or to both.</p></li>
<li><p>The ordering positions for dependent vowels
(matras). Specifically, right-side, above-base, and below-base
matras follow different rules in different scripts.
All Indic scripts position left-side matras in the same
manner, in the ordering position <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">POS_PREBASE_MATRA</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With regard to these common variations, Bengali’s specific shaping
characteristics include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BASE_POS_LAST</span></code> = The base consonant of a syllable is the last
consonant, not counting any special final-consonant forms.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">REPH_POS_AFTER_SUBJOINED</span></code> = “Reph” is ordered after all subjoined (i.e.,

<h3>1: Identifying syllables and other sequences<a class="headerlink" href="#identifying-syllables-and-other-sequences" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A syllable in Bengali consists of a valid orthographic sequence
that may be followed by a “tail” of modifier signs.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: The Bengali Unicode block enumerates five modifier signs,
“Candrabindu” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+0981</span></code>), “Anusvara” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+0982</span></code>), “Visarga”
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+0983</span></code>), “Avagraha” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09BD</span></code>), and “Vedic Anusvara”
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09FC</span></code>). In addition, Sanskrit text written in Bengali may
include additional signs from Vedic Extensions block.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Each syllable contains exactly one vowel sound. Valid syllables may
begin with either a consonant or an independent vowel.</p>
<p>If the syllable begins with a consonant, then the consonant that
provides the vowel sound is referred to as the “base” consonant. If
the syllable begins with an independent vowel, that vowel is the
syllable’s only vowel sound and serves as the “base”.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: A consonant that is not accompanied by a dependent vowel (matra) sign
carries the script’s inherent vowel sound. This vowel sound is changed
by a dependent vowel (matra) sign following the consonant.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>From the shaping engine’s perspective, the main distinction between a
syllable with a base consonant and a syllable with an
independent-vowel base is that a syllable with an independent-vowel
base is less likely to include additional consonants in special forms
and less likely to include dependent vowel signs
(matras). Therefore, in the common case, vowel-based syllables may
involve less reordering, substitution feature applications, and other
processing than consonant-based syllables.</p>
<p>In some languages and orthographies, vowel-based syllables are
not permitted to include additional consonants or matras, and certain
GSUB substitution features do not occur. However, there are often
known exceptions, and real-world text makes no such guarantees.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: Shaping engines may choose to treat independent-vowel bases
like base consonants for the sake of simplicity or code
reuse.</p>
<p>However, implementations that take this approach should note
that removing the distinction between base consonants and
independent-vowel bases entirely may have unintended
consequences. Making guarantees about the correctness of the results
or about language-specific tests is out of scope for this document.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, the base consonant is the final consonant of the
syllable and its vowel sound designates the end of the syllable. This
rule is synonymous with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BASE_POS_LAST</span></code> characteristic mentioned
earlier.</p>
<p>Non-base consonants in a valid syllable will be separated by “Halant”
marks. Pre-base consonants will be followed by “Halant”, while
post-base consonants will be preceded by “Halant”.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Pre-baseC Halant BaseC Halant Post-baseC
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The algorithm for correctly identifying the base consonant includes a
test to recognize these sequences and not mis-identify the base
consonant.</p>
<p>All consonants in Bengali can potentially occur in pre-base
position. The “Halant” marks on pre-base consonants indicate that they
carry no vowel. Instead, they affect syllable pronunciation by
combining with the base consonant (e.g., “<em>thr</em>” or “<em>spl</em>”).</p>
<p>Three consonants in Bengali are allowed to occur after the base
consonant or syllable base: “Ya”, “Ba”, and “Ra”. When these consonants occur after the
base consonant or syllable base, they take on special forms.</p>
<p>A “Ya” after the base consonant or syllable base takes on the “Yaphala” form.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: some fonts may also implement the “Yaphala” form for a
post-base “Yya” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09DF</span></code>).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A “Ba” after the base consonant or syllable bases takes on the below-base “Baphala”
form. A “Ba” before the base consonant or syllable base will take on the below-base
“Baphala” form unless it is the first pre-base consonant in the syllable.</p>
<p>As with other Indic scripts, the consonant “Ra” receives special
treatment; in many circumstances it is replaced by one of two combining
mark-like forms.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A “Ra,Halant” sequence at the beginning of a syllable is replaced
with an above-base mark called “Reph” (unless the “Ra” is the only
consonant in the syllable). This rule is synonymous with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">REPH_MODE_IMPLICIT</span></code> characteristic mentioned earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>A non-initial “Ra” before the base consonant or syllable base or a “Ra” after the
base consonant or syllable base takes on the below-base form “Raphala.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Reph” characters must be reordered after the
syllable-identification stage is complete.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;bng2&gt;</span></code> text contains two Unicode codepoints for “Ra.”
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09B0</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09F0</span></code>.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09B0</span></code> is used in Bengali-language, Manipuri-language, and
Sanskrit text. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09F0</span></code> is used in Assamese-language text.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: Generally speaking, OpenType fonts will implement support for
any below-base, post-base, and pre-base-reordering consonant forms
by including the necessary substitution rules in their <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">blwf</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pstf</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pref</span></code> lookups in GSUB.</p>
<p>Consequently, whenever shaping engines need to determine whether or
not a given consonant can take on such a special form, the most
appropriate test is to check if the consonant is included in the
relevant GSUB lookup. Other implementations are possible, such as
maintaining static tables of consonants, but checking for GSUB
support ensures that the expected behavior is implemented in the
active font, and is therefore the most reliable approach.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In addition to valid syllables, standalone sequences may occur, such
as when an isolated codepoint is shown in example text.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: Foreign loanwords, when written in the Bengali script, may
not adhere to the syllable-formation rules described above. In
particular, it is not uncommon to encounter foreign loanwords that
contain a word-final suffix of consonants.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, such word-final suffixes will be correctly matched by
the regular expressions listed below. These loanwords are pronounced
different, which raises issues for potential readers, but the
character sequences do not affect the shaping process.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Syllables should be identified by examining the run and matching
glyphs, based on their categorization, using regular expressions.</p>
<p>The following general-purpose Indic-shaping regular expressions can be
used to match Bengali syllables.</p>
<p>The regular expressions utilize the shaping classes from the tables
above. For the purpose of syllable identification, more general
classes can be used, as defined in the following table. This
simplifies the resulting expressions.</p>

<p>The primary problem involved in shaping broken syllables is the lack
of a syllable base (either a base consonant or an independent
vowel). Without a syllable base, the shaping engine cannot perform
GPOS positioning and other contextual operations that are required
later in the shaping process.</p>
<p>To make up for this limitation, shaping engines should insert a
dotted-circle placeholder (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+25CC</span></code>) character into the text stream
where the missing syllable base was expected to occur. This
placeholder allows the shaping process to proceed on a best-effort
basis at handling the broken-syllable sequence, but making guarantees
about the orthographic correctness or preferred appearance of the
final result is out of scope for this document.</p>
<p>Shaping engines can perform this dotted-circle insertion at any point
after the broken syllable has been recognized and before GSUB features
are applied. However, the best results will likely be attained by
performing the insertion immediately, before proceeding to
stage 2. This will enable the maximum number of GSUB and GPOS features
in the active font to be correctly applied to the text run by ensuring
that all reordering, tagging, and sorting algorithms are executed as
usual.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: In software stacks where other text-handling operations, such
as Unicode normalization and localization, are performed before the
text run is passed to the shaping engine, there is a potential for
the dotted-circle insertion to cause unexpected effects.</p>
<p>For example, if a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccmp</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locl</span></code> feature substitutes the default
dotted-circle placeholder glyph with a variant glyph of a different
size or weight for the (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+25CC</span></code>) codepoint, then any shaping engine
which relies on another software component to handle that
functionality must take additional care to ensure consistency.</p>

<p>While performing the base-consonant search, shaping engines may
also encounter special-form consonants, including below-base
consonants and post-base consonants. Each of these special-form
consonants must also be tagged (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">POS_BELOWBASE_CONSONANT</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">POS_POSTBASE_CONSONANT</span></code>, respectively).</p>
<p>Any pre-base-reordering consonant (such as a pre-base-reordering “Ra”)
encountered during the base-consonant search must be tagged

<p>Second, any two-part dependent vowels (matras) must be decomposed
into their left-side and right-side components. Bengali has two
two-part dependent vowels, “O” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09CB</span></code>) and “Au” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09CC</span></code>). Each

Unicode-normalization stage. However, all such decompositions must be
completed before the shaping engine begins step three, below.</p>

<p>For simplicity, shaping engines may choose to tag single-part matras

<p>Fourth, any subsequences of marks that include a “Nukta” and a
“Halant” or Vedic sign must be reordered so that the “Nukta” appears
first.</p>
<p>This means that the subsequence “Halant,Nukta” is reordered to
“Nukta,Halant” and that the subsequence “<em>Vedic_sign</em>,Nukta” is
reordered to “Nukta,_Vedic_sign”.</p>
<p>For subsequences of affected marks that are longer than two, the
reordering operation must be repeated until the “Nukta” is the first
character in the subsequence. No other marks in the subsequence
should be reordered.</p>
<p>This order is canonical in Unicode and is required so that
“<em>consonant</em>,Nukta” substitution rules from GSUB will be correctly
matched later in the shaping process.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: Bengali includes the consonant “Yya” (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09DF</span></code>), which is

(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09AF</span></code>,<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+09BC</span></code>). “Ya” can also take on the post-base “Yaphala”
form when it occurs in the sequence “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SYLLABLE_BASE</span></code>,Halant,Ya”.</p>
<p>Consequently, shaping engines that encounter a “Ya,Nukta”
sequence may wish to recompose that sequence to “Yya” earlier than
other nukta-variant substitutions, as a safeguard
against the decomposed “Ya” unintentionally triggering a “Yaphala”
substitution during GSUB feature application (if the sequence in
question happens to match the “Yaphala” substitution rule as well as
the “Yya” substitution rule).</p>

<p>With the initial reordering complete, those glyphs in the syllable that

flagged for each potential feature.</p>
<p>This flagging is preliminary; the set of potential features varies
between different scripts and which features are supported varies
between fonts. It is also possible that the application of
one feature on a glyph sequence will perform a substitution that makes
a later feature no longer applicable to the updated sequence.</p>

to the stages during which features are applied.</p>

<ul class="simple">

<h3>4: Final reordering<a class="headerlink" href="#final-reordering" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The final reordering stage repositions marks, dependent-vowel (matra)

the base consonant or syllable base. Because multiple substitutions
may have occurred during the application of the basic-shaping features

<section id="id1">
<h4>4.1: Base consonant<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The final reordering stage, like the initial reordering stage, begins
with determining the syllable base of each syllable, following the
same algorithm used in stage 2, step 1.</p>
<p>In a syllable that begins with an independent vowel, the independent
vowel will always serve as the syllable base. In a standalone sequence or
other syllable that begins with a placeholder or a dotted circle, the
placeholder or dotted circle will always serve as the syllable base.</p>
<p>In a syllable that begins with a consonant, the shaping engine must
repeat the base-consonant search algorithm used in stage 2, step 1.</p>
<p>The codepoint of the underlying base consonant or syllable base will
not change between the search performed in stage 2, step 1, and the
search repeated here. However, the application of GSUB shaping
features in stage 3 means that several ligation and many-to-one
substitutions may have taken place. The final glyph produced by that
process may, therefore, be a conjunct or ligature form — in most
cases, such a glyph will not have an assigned Unicode codepoint.</p>

<h4>4.2: Pre-base matras<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-base-matras" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Pre-base dependent vowels (matras) that were reordered during the

consonant.</p></li>
<li><p>If a zero-width joiner follows this last standalone “Halant”, the
final matra position is moved to after the joiner.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the matra will move to the right of all explicit
“consonant,Halant” subsequences, but will stop to the left of the base
consonant or syllable base, all conjuncts or ligatures that contain
the base consonant or syllable base, and all half forms.</p>
<p><img alt="Pre-base matra reordering" src="_images/bengali-matra-position.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: OpenType and Unicode both state that if the syllable includes
a ZWJ immediately after the last “Halant”, then the final matra
position should be after the ZWJ.</p>
<p>However, there are several test sequences indicating that
Microsoft’s Uniscribe shaping engine did not follow this rule (in,
at least, Devanagari and Bengali text), and in these circumstances
Uniscribe instead makes the final matra position before the final
“Consonant,Halant,ZWJ”.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the HarfBuzz shaping engine has also followed the same
pattern. If other shaping engine implementations prefer to maintain
maximum compatibility with Uniscribe and HarfBuzz, then they should
also follow suit.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: The Microsoft script-development specifications for OpenType
shaping also state that if a zero-width non-joiner follows the last
standalone “Halant”, the final matra position is moved to after the
non-joiner. However, it is unnecessary to test for this condition,
because a “Halant,ZWNJ” subsequence is, by definition, the end of a

<h4>4.3: Reph<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>“Reph” must be moved from the beginning of the syllable to its final

immediately after the syllable base and any subjoined (below-base
consonant or below-base dependent vowel) forms.</p>
<p>The algorithm for finding the final “Reph” position is</p>
<!---
  - If the syllable does not have a base consonant (such as a syllable
    based on an independent vowel or placeholder), then the final
    "Reph" position is immediately before the first character tagged
    with the `POS_BEFORE_POST` position or any later position in the
    sort order.

    -- If there are no characters tagged with `POS_BEFORE_POST` or
       later positions, then "Reph" is positioned at the end of the
       syllable.
--->
<ul>
<li><p>Starting at the first post-“Reph” consonant, search forward looking
for the first explicit “Halant”, ending the search when the base
consonant is encountered. If such an explicit “Halant” is found,
move the “Reph” to the position immediately after this
“Halant”.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If a zero-width joiner (ZWJ) or a zero-width non-joiner (ZWNJ)
follows this “Halant”, move the “Reph” to the position
immediately after the ZWJ or ZWNJ. This will be the final
“Reph” position.</p></li>
<li><p>If no ZWJ or ZWNJ follows this “Halant”, leave the “Reph” in
its position immediately after the “Halant”. This will be the
final “Reph” position.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If no such explicit “Halant” is found in the previous step, find
the first post-base consonant that has not formed a ligature with
the base consonant. If such a non-ligated post-base consonant is
found, move the “Reph” to the position immediately before the
non-ligated post-base consonant. This will be the final “Reph”
position.</p></li>
<li><p>If no such non-ligated post-base consonant is found in the
previous step, move the “Reph” to the position immediately before
the first post-base matra, syllable modifier, or Vedic sign that
has a positioning tag after the script’s “Reph” position in the
syllable sort order (as listed in <a class="reference internal" href="#initial-reordering"><span class="std std-doc">stage
2</span></a>). This will be the final “Reph”
position.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Note: Because Bengali incorporates the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">REPH_POS_AFTER_SUBJOINED</span></code> shaping characteristic, this means
any positioning tag of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">POS_BEFORE_POST</span></code> or later,

<p>Finally, if the final position of “Reph” occurs after a

<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Pre-baseC Halant BaseC Post-baseC Halant
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>before features are applied.</p>
<p>In <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;bng2&gt;</span></code> text, as described above in this document, there is no
such reordering. The correct sequence to match for GSUB substitutions is
“<em>Consonant</em>,Halant” for pre-base consonants, but “Halant,<em>Consonant</em>”
for post-base consonants.</p>
<p>The old Indic shaping model also did not recognize the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BLWF_MODE_PRE_AND_POST</span></code> shaping characteristic. Instead, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;beng&gt;</span></code>
was treated as if it followed the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BLWF_MODE_POST_ONLY</span></code>
characteristic. In other words, below-base form substitutions were
only applied to consonants after the base consonant or syllable base.</p>
<p>In addition, for some scripts, left-side dependent vowel marks
(matras) were not repositioned during the final reordering
stage. For <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;beng&gt;</span></code> text, the left-side matra was always positioned
at the beginning of the syllable.</p>

<p>Shaping engines may choose to match post-base “<em>Consonant</em>,Halant”

<p>Shaping engines may choose to match post-base “<em>Consonant</em>,Halant”
sequences for GSUB substitutions or to reorder them to
“Halant,<em>Consonant</em>” when processing text runs that are tagged with
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;beng&gt;</span></code> script tag and it is known that the font in use supports
only the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;bng2&gt;</span></code> shaping model.</p>
<p>Shaping engines may also choose to apply <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">blwf</span></code> substitutions to
below-base consonants occurring before the base consonant or syllable base when it is
known that the font in use supports an applicable substitution lookup.</p>
<p>Shaping engines may also choose to position left-side matras according
to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;beng&gt;</span></code> ordering scheme; however, doing so might interfere
with matching GSUB or GPOS features.</p>
