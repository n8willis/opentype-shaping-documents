# Notes #

This directory includes auxiliary information that is either
tangential to the main shaping-behavior documentation or is
excessively long enough that trying to include it inline would disrupt
the flow of the text for readers.

Notes included cover:

  - [Uniscribe compatibility](/notes/uniscribe-bug-compatibility.md):
    Information on preserving strict compatibility with Microsoft's
    Uniscribe shaping engine
  - [Ragel state-machine operators](/notes/ragel-machine-notation.md):
    Information on the syntax of the
    [Ragel](http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/) state-machine
    compiler, which is the reference regular-expression syntax used
    when listing regular expressions in the shaping-behavior
    documentation, but which itself is not mandatory.
