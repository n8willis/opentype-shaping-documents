## General information ##

The Myanmar or Burmese script is a descendant of the Brahmi script, and follows
many of the same general patterns found in [Indic
scripts](opentype-shaping-indic-general.md). However, Myanmar
incorporates enough distinctions of its own that it is generally not
advisable to attempt supporting it in a general-purpose Indic shaping
engine. 

For example, Myanmar script includes a "Reph"-like feature known as
"Kinzi" although, unlike "Reph", a "Kinzi" may be formed by any of
several initial consonants. Also, notably, real-world texts written in
Myanmar script often do not use inter-word spaces, which may make the
process of syllable identification substantially different from
processing Indic scripts.

The Myanmar script is used to write multiple languages, most commonly
Burmese, Mon, Karen, Kayah, Shan, Palaung, and Pali. In addition,
Sanskrit may be written in Myanmar, so Myanmar script runs may include 
glyphs from the Vedic Extensions block of Unicode. 

There are two extant Myanmar script tags defined in OpenType, `<mymr>`
and `<mym2>`. The older script tag, `<mymr>`, was deprecated in 2005.
Therefore, new fonts should be engineered to work with the `<mym2>`
shaping model. However, if a font is encountered that supports only
`<mymr>`, the shaping engine should deal with it gracefully.

## Terminology ##

OpenType shaping uses a standard set of terms for Brahmi-derived and
Indic scripts.  The terms used colloquially in any particular language
may vary, however, potentially causing confusion.

**Matra** is the standard term for a dependent vowel sign. Syllables
in Myanmar script can include sequences of multiple vowels and,
therefore, multiple matras.

**Halant** and **Virama** are both standard terms for the below-base
"vowel-killer" mark. Unicode documents use the term "virama" most
frequently, while OpenType documents use the term "halant" most
frequently.

**Asat** is the term for the "pure killer" character in Myanmar. An
asat after a consonant serves a similar function as a halant by
suppressing the inherent vowel of the consonant, but the asat is
rendered visually, either as an above-base mark or in a substitution
form triggered by an adjacent codepoint.

An asat may be placed following a consonant to denote that the
consonant is doubled. An asat may also be followed by a halant, a
sequence that is used to trigger the "Kinzi" special form.

**Chandrabindu** (or simply **Bindu**) is the standard term for the
diacritical mark indicating that the preceding vowel should be
nasalized. Myanmar script does not use a chandrabindu; however, the
_BINDU_ category is used for other marks during the
syllable-identification stage in order to maintain compatibility with
other scripts. 

**Tone markers** are an important part of languages written in Myanmar
script. These markers may be either spacing-combining (`[Mc]`) or
non-spacing (`[Mn]`). Several tone markers may be used within a single
syllable.

The term **base consonant** is also critical to Myanmar shaping. The
base consonant of a syllable is the consonant that carries the
syllable's vowel sound, either the inherent vowel (for an unmarked
base consonant) or a dependent vowel (with the addition of a matra). 

A syllable's base consonant is generally rendered in its full form
(although it may form ligatures), while other consonants in the
syllable frequently take on secondary forms. Different GSUB
substitutions may apply to a script's **pre-base** and **post-base**
consonants. Some of these substitutions create **above-base** or
**below-base** forms. The **Kinzi** form of certain consonants is an
example, akin to the "Reph" form of "Ra" in many Indic scripts.

Many Myanmar letters may be followed by a **Variation Selector**
codepoint in order to request the **dotted form** of the corresponding
glyph, which is preferred for some languages written with Myanmar
script. Fonts are not required to include the dotted-form variants;
when they are absent from the active font, the default form of the
corresponding letter will be used instead.

Where possible, using the standard terminology is preferred, as the
use of a language-specific term necessitates choosing one language
over all of the others that share a common script.

## Glyph classification ##

Shaping Myanmar text depends on the shaping engine correctly
classifying each glyph in the run. As with most other scripts, the
classifications must distinguish between consonants, vowels
(independent and dependent), numerals, punctuation, and various types
of diacritical mark. 

For most codepoints, the `General Category` property defined in the Unicode
standard is correct, but it is not sufficient to fully capture the
expected shaping behavior (such as glyph reordering). Therefore,
Myanmar glyphs must additionally be classified by how they are treated
when shaping a run of text.

### Shaping classes and subclasses ###

The shaping classes listed in the tables that follow are defined so
that they capture the positioning rules used by Myanmar script. 

For most codepoints, the _Shaping class_ is synonymous with the `Indic
Syllabic Category` defined in Unicode. However, there are some
distinctions, where the defined category does not fully capture the
behavior of the character in the shaping process.

Several of the diacritic and syllable-modifying marks behave according
to their own rules and, thus, have a special class. These include
`BINDU` and `VISARGA`. Some less-common marks behave according to
rules that are similar to these common marks, and are therefore
classified with the corresponding common mark. The Vedic Extensions
also include a `CANTILLATION` class for tone marks.

Myanmar's "halant" codepoint is classified as `INVISIBLE_STACKER`,
rather than the more common `VIRAMA`. This is to indicate that, unlike
the "halant"/"virama" characters in several other scripts, the Myanmar
"halant" is never rendered visually as a glyph.

Myanmar's "Asat" codepoint, however, is rendered visually when it
appears in a syllable. The "Asat" behaves differently than Indic
"halant", however. It can be used to kill a consonant's inherent vowel
sound, but it is not used between consonants to indicate the formation
of a conjunct or a subjoined form. The "Asat" is classified as
`PURE_KILLER`.

Letters generally fall into the classes `CONSONANT`,
`VOWEL_INDEPENDENT`, and `VOWEL_DEPENDENT`. These classes help the
shaping engine parse and identify key positions in a syllable. For
example, Unicode categorizes dependent vowels as `Mark [Mn]`, but the
shaping engine must be able to distinguish between dependent vowels
and diacritical marks (which are categorized as `Mark [Mn]`).

Myanmar uses one subclass of consonant, `CONSONANT_MEDIAL`. This
subclass is used for special non-base variants of several consonants that
serve to modify the syllable's vowel sound. These medial consonants
are rendered as non-spacing marks attached to the base consonant.

> Note: The medial "Ra" is reordered to pre-base-consonant
> position. The other medial consonants do not require reordering.

> Note: The medial consonants are encoded in separate codepoints,
> distinguishing them from the standard (non-medial) variant of the
> corresponding consonant. 

In addition, the Myanmar and Myanmar Extended Unicode blocks include
several codepoints classified as `CONSONANT_PLACEHOLDER`. These
codepoints are used in verbal transcriptions to take tone
marks. However, these glyphs are not consonants in the true sense and
are unlikely to occur within normal words.

Other characters, such as symbols, need no special
attention from the shaping engine, so they are not assigned a shaping
class.

Numbers are classified as `NUMBER`, even though they evoke no special
behavior from the Indic shaping rules, because there are OpenType features that
might affect how the respective glyphs are drawn, such as `tnum`,
which specifies the usage of tabular-width numerals, and `sups`, which
replaces the default glyphs with superscript variants.

Marks and dependent vowels are further labeled with a mark-placement
subclass, which indicates where the glyph will be placed with respect
to the base character to which it is attached. The actual position of
the glyphs is determined by the lookups found in the font's GPOS
table, however, the shaping rules for Indic scripts require that the
shaping engine be able to identify marks by their general
position. 

For example, left-side dependent vowels (matras), classified
with `LEFT_POSITION`, must frequently be reordered. Therefore, the
`LEFT_POSITION` subclass of the character must be tracked throughout
the shaping process.

There are four basic _mark-placement subclasses_ for dependent vowels
(matras). Each corresponds to the visual position of the matra with
respect to the base consonant to which it is attached:

  - `LEFT_POSITION` matras are positioned to the left of the base consonant.
  - `RIGHT_POSITION` matras are positioned to the right of the base consonant.
  - `TOP_POSITION` matras are positioned above the base consonant.
  - `BOTTOM_POSITION` matras are positioned below base consonant.
  
These positions may also be referred to elsewhere in shaping documents as:

  - _Pre-base_ matras
  - _Post-base_ matras
  - _Above-base_ matras
  - _Below-base_ matras
  
respectively. The `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `TOP`, and `BOTTOM` designations
corresponds to Unicode's preferred terminology. The _Pre_, _Post_,
_Above_, and _Below_ terminology is used in the official descriptions
of OpenType GSUB and GPOS features. Shaping engines may, internally,
use whichever terminology is preferred.

For most mark and dependent-vowel codepoints, the _mark-placement
subclass_ is synonymous with the `Indic Positional Category` defined
in Unicode. However, there are some distinctions, where the defined
category does not fully capture the behavior of the character in the
shaping process. 

Many Myanmar letters may be followed by a `Variation Selector`
codepoint in order to request the "dotted form" of the
corresponding glyph. These variations are defined in Unicode's
`Standardized Variants` document; only the codepoints listed in that
document support substitution via variation selectors. At present,
only "Variation Selector 1" (`U+FE00`) is used with Myanmar.

If the active font does not include glyphs representing the requested
variant of the letter preceding the variation selector, then the
shaping engine must treat the variation selector codepoint as
invisible and ignorable and use the default version of the preceding
letter. 


### Myanmar character tables ###

Separate character tables are provided for the Myanmar and Vedic
Extensions blocks as well as for other miscellaneous characters that
are used in `<mym2>` text runs:

  - [Myanmar character table](character-tables/character-tables-myanmar.md#myanmar-character-table)
  - [Myanmar Extended-A character table](character-tables/character-tables-myanmar.md#myanmar-extended-a-character-table)
  - [Myanmar Extended-B character table](character-tables/character-tables-myanmar.md#myanmar-extended-b-character-table)
  - [Vedic Extensions character table](character-tables/character-tables-myanmar.md#vedic-extensions-character-table)
  - [Miscellaneous character table](character-tables/character-tables-myanmar.md#miscellaneous-character-table)

The tables list each codepoint along with its Unicode general
category, its shaping class, and its mark-placement subclass. The
codepoint's Unicode name and an example glyph are also provided.

For example:

| Codepoint | Unicode category | Shaping class     | Mark-placement subclass    | Glyph                        |
|:----------|:-----------------|:------------------|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|`U+1000`   | Letter           | CONSONANT         | _null_                     | &#x1000; Ka                  |
| | | | |
|`U+1036`   | Mark [Mn]        | BINDU             | TOP_POSITION               | &#x1036; Anusvara            |


Codepoints with no assigned meaning are
designated as _unassigned_ in the _Unicode category_ column. 

Assigned codepoints with a _null_ in the _Shaping class_
column evoke no special behavior from the shaping engine.

The _Mark-placement subclass_ column indicates mark-placement
positioning for codepoints in the _Mark_ category. Assigned, non-mark
codepoints have a _null_ in this column and evoke no special
mark-placement behavior. Marks tagged with [Mn] in the _Unicode
category_ column are categorized as non-spacing; marks tagged with
[Mc] are categorized as spacing-combining.

Some codepoints in the tables use a _Shaping class_ that
differs from the codepoint's Unicode _General Category_. The _Shaping
class_ takes precedence during OpenType shaping, as it captures more
specific, script-aware behavior.

Other important characters that may be encountered when shaping runs
of Myanmar text include the dotted-circle placeholder (`U+25CC`), 
the no-break space (`U+00A0`), and the zero-width space (`U+200B`).

The dotted-circle placeholder is frequently used when displaying a
dependent vowel (matra) or a combining mark in isolation. Real-world
text syllables may also use other characters, such as hyphens or dashes,
in a similar placeholder fashion; shaping engines should cope with
this situation gracefully.

<!--- The zero-width joiner is primarily used to prevent the formation of a
subjoining form from a "_Consonant_,Halant,_Consonant_" sequence. The sequence
"_Consonant_,Halant,ZWJ,_Consonant_" blocks the substitution of a
subjoined form for the second consonant. --->

<!---
A secondary usage of the zero-width joiner is to prevent the formation of
"Reph". An initial "Ra,Halant,ZWJ" sequence should not produce a "Reph",
where an initial "Ra,Halant" sequence without the zero-width joiner
otherwise would.
--->

The no-break space is primarily used to display those codepoints that
are defined as non-spacing (marks, dependent vowels (matras),
below-base consonant forms, and post-base consonant forms) in an
isolated context, as an alternative to displaying them superimposed on
the dotted-circle placeholder. These sequences will match
"NBSP,ZWJ,Halant,_Consonant_", "NBSP,_mark_", or "NBSP,_matra_".

The zero-width space may be used between words — even though no visual
word spacing results — in order to indicate word breaks within a text
that can be used by line-breaking algorithms in a higher-level
typesetting environment.



## The `<mym2>` shaping model ##

Processing a run of `<mym2>` text involves five top-level stages:

1. Identifying syllables and other sequences
2. Initial reordering
3. Applying the basic substitution features from GSUB
4. Applying all remaining substitution features from GSUB
5. Applying all remaining positioning features from GPOS


As with other Brahmi-derived and Indic scripts, the initial reordering
stage and the final reordering stage each involve applying a set of several
script-specific rules. The basic substitution features must be applied
to the run in a specific order. The remaining substitution features in
stage four, however, do not have a mandatory order.


Myanmar exhibits many of the same shaping patterns found in Indic
scripts, but it differs in a few critical characteristics. With regard
to these common variations, Myanmar's specific shaping 
characteristics include:


  - The first consonant of a syllable is always the base consonant,
    excluding a consonant that is part of an initial "Kinzi"-forming
    sequence (if it is present).

> Note: For comparison with the General Indic shaping model, this
> characteristic would correspond to `BASE_POS_FIRST`.
  
  - "Kinzi" is always encoded as a syllable-initial sequence, but it
    is reordered. The final position of "Kinzi" is immediately after
    the base consonant. 

> Note: For comparison with the General Indic shaping model, the Kinzi
> -encoding characteristic would correspond to `REPH_MODE_EXPLICIT`,
> and the reordering characteristic would correspond to `POS_AFTER_MAIN`.
  
  - The below-base forms feature is applied only to consonants
    after the base consonant. 

> Note: For comparison with the General Indic shaping model, this
> characteristic would correspond to `BLWF_MODE_POST_ONLY`.

  - Medial Ra is reordered to pre-base position.

  - Pre-base matras are reordered to the beginning of the
    syllable. Multiple pre-base matras can occur; any such sequences
    must be moved together, as a block, at the reordering stage.

> Note: For comparison with the General Indic shaping model, this
> characteristic is distinct to Mynanmar script. Indic scripts apply 
> different reordering rules to pre-base matras that depend on the
> contents of the syllable.
	
  - The ordering positions for right-side and above-base matras is the
    same. All are reordered to immediately after all subjoined consonants.
	
  - Below-base matras are reordered to immediately before any
    right-side and above-base matras.
    	
> Note: For comparison with the General Indic shaping model, this
> characteristic would correspond to `MATRA_POS_TOP`,
> `MATRA_POS_RIGHT` taking the ordering position 
> `POS_AFTER_SUBJOINED`, and `MATRA_POS_BOTTOM` taking the ordering
> position `POS_BELOWBASE_CONSONANT`. 



### 1: Identifying syllables and other sequences ###

A syllable in Myanmar consists of a valid orthographic sequence
that may be followed by a "tail" of modifier signs. 

> Note: The Myanmar Unicode block enumerates two modifier signs,
> "Anusvara" (`U+1036`) and "Visarga" (`U+1038`). There are also
> twenty-one tone markers in the Myanmar and Myanmar Extended-A
> blocks. In addition, Sanskrit text written in Myanmar may include
> additional signs from Vedic Extensions block.

Because texts written in Myanmar script do not generally employ
inter-word spaces, however, shaping engines must rely on
syllable-identification algorithms to recognize word-boundary
patterns — distinguishing numeric sequences, symbols, punctuation, and other
miscellaneous script characters from syllables within words.

Each syllable contains exactly one vowel sound. Valid syllables may
begin with either a consonant or an independent vowel. 

If the syllable begins with a consonant, then the consonant that
provides the vowel sound is referred to as the "base" consonant. If
the syllable begins with an independent vowel, that vowel is the
syllable's only vowel sound and, by definition, there is no "base"
consonant. 

> Note: A consonant that is not accompanied by a dependent vowel (matra) sign
> carries the script's inherent vowel sound. This vowel sound is changed
> by a dependent vowel (matra) sign following the consonant.

Generally speaking, the base consonant is the first consonant of the
syllable and its vowel sound designates the end of the syllable. The
exception to this rule is consonants that are part of a
"Kinzi"-triggering sequence.

Post-base consonants in a valid syllable will be preceded by "Halant"
marks. 

	BaseC Halant Post-baseC
	
The algorithm for correctly identifying the base consonant includes a
test to recognize these sequences and not mis-identify the base
consonant.

Medial consonants, if they occur, will not be preceded by a
"Halant". This is because medial consonants in Myanmar are used to
modify the vowel sound of the syllable.

> Note: in the Myanmar script, all medial consonants have their own
> distinct codepoints. Therefore, they can be identified by codepoint
> alone, and there is no need for a text run to identify them using
> any special sequences.


As with other Brahmi-derived and Indic scripts, the consonant "Ra" receives
special treatment. 

  - A "Medial Ra" (`U+103C`) must be reordered to a position immediately
    before the syllable's base consonant. 
	
	Note, however, that "Medial Ra" is a separate codepoint from the
    standard "Ra" (`U+101B`). 
	
  - A syllable-initial "Ra" may also be part of a "Kinzi"-triggering
    sequence. 
	
	Notably, however, although "Ra" alone will take on the "Reph" form
    in Indic script sequences, the Myanmar script's "Kinzi" feature
    can be triggered for three consonants, depending on the language
    in use: "Ra" (`U+101B`), "Nga" (`U+1004`), and "Mon Nga"
    (`U+105A`). In each case, the "Kinzi" form is triggered by an
    explicit sequence: "_consonant_,Asat,Halant".
	
	There are, therefore, exactly three "Kinzi"-forming sequences to
    test for:
	  - "Ra,Asat,Halant"
	  - "Nga,Asat,Halant"
	  - "Mon Nga,Asat,Halant"

![Ra Kinzi](images/myanmar/myanmar-kinzi-ra.png)
![Nga Kinzi](images/myanmar/myanmar-kinzi-nga.png)
![Mon Nga Kinzi](images/myanmar/myanmar-kinzi-monnga.png)

In the Myanmar (or Burmese) language, "Nga" is the only "Kinzi"-forming
consonant. "Mon Nga" can form a "Kinzi" in the Mon language, and "Ra"
can form a "Kinzi" in Sanskrit written with the Myanmar script.

In addition to valid syllables, standalone sequences may occur, such
as when an isolated codepoint is shown in example text.

> Note: Foreign loanwords, when written in the Myanmar script, may
> not adhere to the syllable-formation rules described above. 


Syllables should be identified by examining the run and matching
glyphs, based on their categorization, using regular expressions. 

The following regular expressions can be used to match Myanmar-script
syllables. 

The regular expressions utilize the shaping classes from the tables
above. For the purpose of syllable identification, more general
classes can be used, as defined in the following table. This
simplifies the resulting expressions. 

```markdown
_ra_		= "Ra" | "Nga" | "Mon Nga"
_consonant_ 	= `CONSONANT` | `CONSONANT_PLACEHOLDER` - _ra_

These identification classes form the bases of the following regular
expression elements:

```markdown
C	= _consonant_ | _ra_
Z	= _zwj_ | _zwnj_
K	= _ra_ _asat_ _halant_
Med	= _my_? _mr_? _mw_? _mh_? _asat_?
Vmain	= _matrapre_* _matraabove_* _matrabelow_* _a_* (_db_ _asat_?)?
Vpost	= _matrapost_ _mh_? _asat_* _matraabove_* _a_* (_db_ _asat_?)?
Pwo	= _pt_ _a_* _db_? _asat_?
Tcomplex= _asat_* Med Vmain Vpost* Pwo* _v_* Z?
Tail	= _halant_ | Tcomplex
```

Using the above elements, the following regular expressions define the
possible syllable types:

A consonant-based syllable will match the expression:
```markdown
(K | _cs_)? (C | _vowel_ | _d_ | _gb_) _vs_? (_halant_ (C | _vowel_) _vs_?)* Tail
```

The expressions above use state-machine syntax from the Ragel
state-machine compiler. The operators represent:

```markdown
a* = zero or more copies of a
b+ = one or more copies of b
c? = optional instance of c
d{n} = exactly n copies of d
d{,n} = zero to n copies of d
d{n,} = n or more copies of d
d{n,m} = n to m copies of d
!e = not e
^f = character-level not f
g.h = concatenation of g and h
i|j = i or j
( ) = grouping of expression elements
```



A sequence that does not match any of these expressions should be
regarded as broken. The shaping engine may make a best-effort attempt
to shape the broken sequence, but making guarantees about the
correctness or appearance of the final result is out of scope for this
document.

After the syllables have been identified, each of the subsequent 
shaping stages occurs on a per-syllable basis.


### 2: Initial reordering ###

The initial reordering stage is used to relocate glyphs from the
phonetic order in which they occur in a run of text to the
orthographic order in which they are presented visually.

> Note: Primarily, this means moving dependent-vowel (matra) glyphs, 
> "Kinzi"-forming sequences, and pre-base-reordering medial consonants.
>
> These reordering moves are mandatory. The final-reordering stage
> may make additional moves, depending on the text and on the features
> implemented in the active font.

The syllable should be processed by tagging each glyph with its
intended position based on its ordering category. After all glyphs
have been tagged, the entire syllable should be sorted in stable order,
so that glyphs of the same ordering category remain in the same
relative position with respect to each other.

The final sort order of the ordering categories should be:


<!---	POS_RA_TO_BECOME_REPH --->


	POS_PREBASE_MATRA
	
	POS_PREBASE_CONSONANT

	POS_BASE_CONSONANT
	POS_AFTER_MAIN

	POS_BEFORE_SUBJOINED
	POS_BELOWBASE_CONSONANT
	POS_AFTER_SUBJOINED

<!---	POS_BEFORE_POST
	POS_POSTBASE_CONSONANT
	POS_AFTER_POST --->

<!---	POS_FINAL_CONSONANT --->
<!---	POS_SMVD --->

<!--- question: does Myanmar shape handle Vedic signs differently? --->
<!--- or am I looking at an incomplete version of the reordering --->
<!--- logic? --->
<!--- Perhaps SMVD is all just tagged as _POS_AFTER_SUBJOINED --->
<!--- and captures all tone marks, too? --->

This sort order enumerates all of the possible final positions to
which a codepoint might be reordered in Myanmar script. 

The position names mimic those used in the General Indic shaping
model, for ease of implementation. However, shaping engines are free
to use any naming scheme they choose.

The basic positions (left to right) are dependent
vowels (matras) and consonants positioned before the base
consonant (`POS_PREBASE_MATRA` and `POS_PREBASE_CONSONANT`), the base
consonant (`POS_BASE_CONSONANT`), below-base consonants
(`POS_BELOWBASE_CONSONANT`),
and syllable-modifying or Vedic signs (`POS_SMVD`).

In addition, several secondary positions are defined to handle various
reordering rules that deal with relative, rather than absolute,
positioning. `POS_AFTER_MAIN` means that a character must be
positioned immediately after the base consonant. `POS_BEFORE_SUBJOINED`
and `POS_AFTER_SUBJOINED` mean that a character must be positioned
before or after any below-base consonants, respectively. 

For shaping-engine implementers, the names used for the ordering
categories matter only in that they are unambiguous. 

For a definition of the "base" consonant, refer to step 2.1, which follows.


#### 2.1: Base consonant ####

The first step is to determine the base consonant of the syllable, if
there is one, and tag it as `POS_BASE_CONSONANT`.

The base consonant is defined as the consonant in a consonant-based
syllable that carries the syllable's vowel sound. That vowel sound
will either be provided by the script's inherent vowel (in which case
it is not written with a separate character) or the sound will be designated
by the addition of a dependent-vowel (matra) sign.

Vowel-based syllables, standalone sequences, and broken text runs will
not have base consonants.

The algorithm for determining the base consonant is

  - Starting from the beginning of the syllable, move forwards until a
    `CONSONANT` is found. 
      * If the consonant is part of a "Kinzi" sequence, move to the
        next consonant. 
  - The consonant stopped at will be the base consonant.

> Note: The algorithm considers only `CONSONANT` class consonants, 


#### 2.2: Tag matras ####

Second, all left-side dependent-vowel (matra) signs must be tagged to be
moved to the beginning of the syllable, with `POS_PREBASE_MATRA`.

All right-side and above-base dependent-vowel (matra)
signs are tagged `POS_AFTER_SUBJOINED`.

All below-base dependent-vowel (matra) signs are tagged
`POS_BELOWBASE_CONSONANT`. 

For simplicity, shaping engines may choose to tag matras
in an earlier text-processing step, using the information in the
_Mark-placement subclass_ column of the character tables. It is
critical at this step, however, that all matras correctly tagged
before proceeding to the next step. 

#### 2.3: Anusvara ####

Third, any `ANUSVARA` marks appearing immediately after a below-base
vowel sign must be tagged with `POS_BEFORE_SUBJOINED`, so that the
marks are reordered to a position immediately before the below-base
vowel signs.


#### 2.4: Pre-base-reordering consonants ####

Fourth, all pre-base-reordering consonants must be tagged with
`POS_PREBASE_CONSONANT`. 

Myanmar has one pre-base-reordering consonant: "Medial Ra".

![Pre-base-reordering Medial Ra](images/myanmar/myanmar-medial-ra.png)


#### 2.5: Kinzi ####

Fifth, initial "Kinzi"-triggering sequences that will become "Kinzi"s
must be tagged with `POS_AFTER_MAIN`.

The sequences are:

  - "Ra,Asat,Halant"
  - "Nga,Asat,Halant"
  - "Mon Nga,Asat,Halant"

In the Myanmar (or Burmese) language, "Nga" is the only "Kinzi"-forming
consonant. "Mon Nga" can form a "Kinzi" in the Mon language, and "Ra"
can form a "Kinzi" in Sanskrit written with the Myanmar script.


#### 2.6: Post-base consonants ####

Sixth, any remaining non-base consonants that occur after the base
consonant must be tagged with `POS_AFTER_MAIN`. Full consonants (of
class `CONSONANT`) will be preceded by a "Halant" glyph. Medial
consonants (of class `CONSONANT_MEDIAL`) will not be preceded by a
"Halant" glyph. 

> Note: "Medial Ra" should have been tagged with
> `POS_PREBASE_CONSONANT` in stage 2, step four, and must not be
> re-tagged in this step.



#### 2.7: Mark tagging ####

<!--- not sure this is done!!! --->

Seventh, all marks must be tagged with the same positioning tag as the
closest non-mark character the mark has affinity with, so that they move together
during the sorting step.

For all marks preceding the base consonant, the mark must be tagged
with the same positioning tag as the closest preceding non-mark
consonant.

For all marks occurring after the base consonant, the mark must be
tagged with the same positioning tag as the closest subsequent consonant.

> Note: In this step, joiner and non-joiner characters must also be
> tagged according to the same rules given for marks, even though
> these characters are not categorized as marks in Unicode.


With these steps completed, the syllable can be sorted into the final sort order.


### 3: Applying the basic substitution features from GSUB ###

The basic-substitution stage applies mandatory substitution features
using the rules in the font's GSUB table. In preparation for this
stage, glyph sequences should be tagged for possible application 
of GSUB features.

The order in which these substitutions must be performed is fixed:

	locl
	ccmp
	rphf 
	pref 
	blwf 
	pstf


#### 3.1 locl ####

The `locl` feature replaces default glyphs with any language-specific
variants, based on examining the language setting of the text run.

> Note: Strictly speaking, the use of localized-form substitutions is
> not part of the shaping process, but of the localization process,
> and could take place at an earlier point while handling the text
> run. However, shaping engines are expected to complete the
> application of the `locl` feature before applying the subsequent
> GSUB substitutions in the following steps.

![Local-forms substitution](images/myanmar/myanmar-locl.png)


#### 3.2: ccmp ####

The `ccmp` feature allows a font to substitute mark-and-base sequences
with a pre-composed glyph including the mark and the base, or to
substitute a single glyph into an equivalent decomposed sequence of glyphs. 
 
If present, these composition and decomposition substitutions must be
performed before applying any other GSUB lookups, because
those lookups may be written to match only the `ccmp`-substituted
glyphs. 

> Note: `ccmp` usage is uncommon in Myanmar fonts. Nevertheless,
> shaping engines must apply any `ccmp` substitutions if they are
> present in the active font.


#### 3.3: rphf ####

The `rphf` feature replaces initial "Kinzi"-triggering sequences with
the "Kinzi" glyph. The sequences are:

  - "Ra,Asat,Halant"
  - "Nga,Asat,Halant"
  - "Mon Nga,Asat,Halant"

In the Myanmar (or Burmese) language, "Nga" is the only "Kinzi"-forming
consonant. "Mon Nga" can form a "Kinzi" in the Mon language, and "Ra"
can form a "Kinzi" in Sanskrit written with the Myanmar script.

![Kinzi composition](/images/myanmar/myanmar-kinzi-nga.png)


#### 3.4 pref ####

The `pref` feature replaces pre-base-consonant glyphs with
any special forms. In Myanmar, this can include variant forms for
"Medial Ra" or for the left-side matras "Sign E" (`U+1031`) or "Shan
Sign E" (`U+1084`)

![pref feature application](/images/myanmar/myanmar-pref.png)


#### 3.5: blwf ####

The `blwf` feature replaces below-base-consonant glyphs with any
special forms. In Myanmar, this usually means replacing
post-base-consonant "Halant,_Consonant_" sequences with subjoined
forms of the consonant. 

However, Myanmar includes several other below-base-consonant
forms, including medial consonants and below-base dependent vowel
(matra) signs.

The below-base forms feature is applied only to glyphs occurring after
the base consonant. 

![blwf feature application](/images/myanmar/myanmar-blwf.png)



#### 3.6: pstf ####

The `pstf` feature replaces post-base-consonant glyphs with any
special forms. 

> Note: `pstf` usage is uncommon in Myanmar fonts, because the script
> does not employ special post-base forms of consonants. Nevertheless,
> shaping engines should apply any `pstf` substitutions if they are
> present in the active font.




### 4: Applying all remaining substitution features from GSUB ###

In this stage, the remaining substitution features from the GSUB table
are applied. The order in which these features are applied is not
canonical; they should be applied in the order in which they appear in
the GSUB table in the font. 

	pres
	abvs
	blws
	psts
	liga


The `pres` feature replaces pre-base-consonant glyphs with special
presentations forms. In Myanmar, this can include stylistic variants
of left-side dependent vowels (matras) or of "Medial Ra". 

![Application of the pres feature](/images/myanmar/myanmar-pres.png)


The `abvs` feature replaces above-base-consonant glyphs with special
presentation forms. This usually includes contextual variants of
above-base marks or contextually appropriate mark-and-base ligatures.

![Application of the abvs feature](/images/myanmar/myanmar-abvs.png)


The `blws` feature replaces below-base-consonant glyphs with special
presentation forms. In Myanmar, this can include contextual ligatures
involving below-base dependent vowel marks (matras), medial
consonants, or subjoined consonants.

![Application of the blws feature](/images/myanmar/myanmar-blws.png)


The `psts` feature replaces post-base-consonant glyphs with special
presentation forms. This usually includes replacing right-side
dependent vowels (matras) with stylistic variants.


![Application of the psts feature](/images/myanmar/myanmar-psts.png)


The `liga` feature substitutes standard, optional ligatures that are on
by default. Substitutions made by `liga` may be disabled by
application-level user interfaces.

![Application of the liga feature](/images/myanmar/myanmar-liga.png)



### 5: Applying remaining positioning features from GPOS ###

In this stage, mark positioning, kerning, and other GPOS features are
applied. As with the preceding stage, the order in which these
features are applied is not canonical; they should be applied in the
order in which they appear in the GPOS table in the font.

	dist
	abvm
	blwm
	mark
	mkmk

> Note: The `kern` feature is usually applied at this stage, if it is
> present in the font. However, `kern` is not mandatory for shaping
> Myanmar text and may be disabled by user preference.

The `dist` feature adjusts the horizontal positioning of
glyphs. Unlike `kern`, adjustments made with `dist` do not require the
application or the user to enable any software _kerning_ features, if
such features are optional. 

In Myanmar text, `dist` is typically used to adjust the space around a
pre-base-reordering "Medial Ra", because the "Medial Ra" codepoint is
classified as being of zero width, but is orthographically a glyph
that encloses the adjacent letter.

![Application of the dist feature](/images/myanmar/myanmar-dist.png)


The `abvm` feature positions above-base glyphs for attachment to base
characters. In Myanmar, this includes "Kinzi" and "Asat" in addition
to tone markers, diacritical marks, above-base dependent vowels
(matras), and Vedic signs.

![Application of the abvm feature](/images/myanmar/myanmar-abvm.png)


The `blwm` feature positions below-base glyphs for attachment to base
characters. In Myanmar, this includes subjoined consonants as well as
below-base dependent vowels (matras), medial consonants, tone markers,
diacritical marks, and Vedic signs.

![Application of the blwm feature](/images/myanmar/myanmar-blwm.png)


The `mark` feature positions marks with respect to base glyphs.

![Application of the mark feature](/images/myanmar/myanmar-mark.png)
 

The `mkmk` feature positions marks with respect to preceding marks,
providing proper positioning for sequences of marks that attach to the
same base glyph.

![Application of the mkmk feature](/images/myanmar/myanmar-mkmk.png)



## The `<mymr>` shaping model ##

The older Myanmar script tag, `<mymr>`, has been deprecated. However,
shaping engines may still encounter fonts that were built to work with
`<mymr>` and some users may still have documents that were written to
take advantage of `<mymr>` shaping.

Sparse information is available about how the Microsoft Uniscribe
shaping engine treated `<mymr>` text runs. Documentation from the
HarfBuzz shaping engine suggests that the Uniscribe `<mymr>` shaper
did not perform a significant amount of reordering or application of
Indic-like GSUB features.
