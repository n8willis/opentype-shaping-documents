## General information ##

The Tibetan script was modeled on seventh-century [Indic
scripts](opentype-shaping-indic-general.md) and incorporates several
patterns and conventions found in Indic scripts. However, Tibetan
developed independently and possesses enough major distinctions that
it is inadvisable to attempt supporting it in a general-purpose
Indic shaping engine. 

The Tibetan script is used to write multiple languages, most commonly
Tibetan, Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Ladakhi, and Balti. In addition,
Sanskrit may be written in Tibetan, but the Tibetan script is not used
for Vedic texts, therefore Tibetan text runs are not expected to
include any glyphs from the Vedic Extensions block of Unicode. 

The Tibetan script tag defined in OpenType is `<tibt>`. 

Notably, Tibetan was originally included in version 1.0 of the Unicode
standard, encoded in a block that closely mirrored the structure of
the Indic scripts. However, this encoding for Tibetan was removed in
Unicode 1.1. A new encoding for Tibetan was included in version 2.0 of
the Unicode standard, more appropriately structured for the writing
system.

## Terminology ##

OpenType shaping uses a standard set of terms for Brahmi-derived and
Indic scripts.  The terms used colloquially in any particular language
may vary, however, potentially causing confusion.

**Matra** is the standard term for a dependent vowel sign. Syllables
in Tibetan script can include sequences of multiple vowels and,
therefore, multiple matras. Each matra is either a **above-base** or
a **below-base** form.

Several compound matra codepoints are included in the Tibetan Unicode
block. However, these are only used when transcribing Sanskrit
text. Otherwise, Tibetan syllables will include at most one matra.

**Tsheng** or **tsek** is the term for the small, dot-like mark that is placed
between syllables in a Tibetan word. Sequences of tsek marks are
occasionally used to justify lines of text within a block. For
line-breaking purposes, words may be broken after a tsek mark.

**Srog-med** is the term for the "virama" or "halant" sign (`U+0F84`). However,
the Tibetan script does not natively use the srong-med mark: it is
used only when transcribing text in a language that requires a "halant".

<!--- **Chandrabindu** (or simply **Bindu**) is the standard term for the
diacritical mark indicating that the preceding vowel should be
nasalized. Tibetan script does not use a chandrabindu; however, the
_BINDU_ category is used for other marks during the
syllable-identification stage in order to maintain compatibility with
other scripts. --->

<!--- Tibetan has a bindu, but it seems to be there just for
      transcription --->

The term **base consonant** in Tibetan is analogous to its usage in
Indic and Brahmi-derived scripts. The base consonant of a syllable is
rendered in its full form; subsequent consonants are generally shown
in **subjoined** form, stacked below the base consonant.

The Tibetan Unicode block includes separate codepoints for the base
and subjoined forms of each consonant. Therefore, shaping engines are
not required to determine the base consonant of a syllable
algorithmically.

Tibetan also employs the term **head consonant**, which refers to the
consonant in a stack that is in the visually topmost position. Certain
consonants take on an alternate form when used in stack-initial
positions (such as "Ra"). When the alternate form is visually the
topmost consonant in the stack, it is regarded as the head consonant,
even though the consonant that follows is regarded as the base
consonant.

For example, the sequence "Ra,Subjoined Ka" (`U+0F62`,`U+0F90`) is
rendered with the "Ka" in its non-subjoined, base-consonant form and the "Ra"
positioned above. In this circumstance, the "Ra" would still be
regarded as the head consonant.



Where possible, using the standard terminology is preferred, as the
use of a language-specific term necessitates choosing one language
over all of the others that share a common script.

## Glyph classification ##

Shaping Tibetan text depends on the shaping engine correctly
classifying each glyph in the run. As with most other scripts, the
classifications must distinguish between consonants, vowels
(independent and dependent), numerals, punctuation, and various types
of diacritical mark. 

For most codepoints, the `General Category` property defined in the Unicode
standard is correct, but it is not sufficient to fully capture the
expected shaping behavior (such as glyph reordering). Therefore,
Tibetan glyphs must additionally be classified by how they are treated
when shaping a run of text.

### Shaping classes and subclasses ###

The shaping classes listed in the tables that follow are defined so
that they capture the positioning rules used by Tibetan script. 

For most codepoints, the _Shaping class_ is synonymous with the `Indic
Syllabic Category` defined in Unicode. However, there are some
distinctions, where the defined category does not fully capture the
behavior of the character in the shaping process.

Several of the diacritic and syllable-modifying marks behave according
to their own rules and, thus, have a special class. These include
`BINDU` and `VISARGA`. Some less-common marks behave according to
rules that are similar to these common marks, and are therefore
classified with the corresponding common mark.

Letters generally fall into the classes `CONSONANT`,
`VOWEL_INDEPENDENT`, and `VOWEL_DEPENDENT`. These classes help the
shaping engine parse and identify key positions in a syllable. For
example, Unicode categorizes dependent vowels as `Mark [Mn]`, but the
shaping engine must be able to distinguish between dependent vowels
and diacritical marks (which are categorized as `Mark [Mn]`).

Tibetan uses two subclasses of consonant, `CONSONANT_SUBJOINED` and
`CONSONANT_HEAD`. 

The `CONSONANT_SUBJOINED` subclass is used for consonants immediately
following the base consonant of a syllable and before the vowel
sound. Unlike most Indic scripts, Tibetan explicitly encodes the
subjoined forms of each consonant in a separate codepoint. Therefore,
the shaping engine is not responsible for identifying the base and
below-base consonants (or other special forms) and fonts are not
responsible for implementing substitution features to substitute
subjoined forms in context.

The `CONSONANT_HEAD` subclass is used for special transliteration
letters that are not found in the Tibetan language. They should pass
checks for consonants, but do not evoke special shaping behavior.

Other characters, such as symbols, need no special
attention from the shaping engine, so they are not assigned a shaping
class.

Numbers are classified as `NUMBER`, even though they evoke no special
behavior from the Indic shaping rules, because there are OpenType features that
might affect how the respective glyphs are drawn, such as `tnum`,
which specifies the usage of tabular-width numerals, and `sups`, which
replaces the default glyphs with superscript variants.

Marks, subjoined consonants, and dependent vowels are further labeled
with a mark-placement subclass, which indicates where the glyph will
be placed with respect to the base character to which it is
attached. The actual position of the glyphs is determined by the
lookups found in the font's GPOS table.

There are two basic _mark-placement subclasses_ for dependent vowel signs
(matras). Each corresponds to the visual position of the matra with
respect to the base consonant to which it is attached:

  - `TOP_POSITION` matras are positioned above the base consonant.
  - `BOTTOM_POSITION` matras are positioned below the base consonant.
  
Syllable modifiers and other marks may be placed in `TOP` or `BOTTOM`
position, or:

  - `LEFT_POSITION` marks are positioned to the left of the base consonant.
  - `RIGHT_POSITION` marks are positioned to the right of the base consonant.

These positions may also be referred to elsewhere in shaping documents as:

  - _Above-base_ 
  - _Below-base_ 
  - _Pre-base_ 
  - _Post-base_ 
  
respectively. The `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `TOP`, and `BOTTOM` designations
corresponds to Unicode's preferred terminology. The _Pre_, _Post_,
_Above_, and _Below_ terminology is used in the official descriptions
of OpenType GSUB and GPOS features. Shaping engines may, internally,
use whichever terminology is preferred.

For most mark and dependent-vowel codepoints, the _mark-placement
subclass_ is synonymous with the `Indic Positional Category` defined
in Unicode. However, there are some distinctions, where the defined
category does not fully capture the behavior of the character in the
shaping process. 



### Tibetan character tables ###

Separate character tables are provided for the Tibetan block as well
as for other miscellaneous characters that are used in `<tibt>` text
runs:

  - [Tibetan character table](character-tables/character-tables-tibetan.md#tibetan-character-table)
  - [Miscellaneous character table](character-tables/character-tables-tibetan.md#miscellaneous-character-table)

The tables list each codepoint along with its Unicode general
category, its shaping class, and its mark-placement subclass. The
codepoint's Unicode name and an example glyph are also provided.

For example:

| Codepoint | Unicode category | Shaping class     | Mark-placement subclass    | Glyph                        |
|:----------|:-----------------|:------------------|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|`U+0F40`   | Letter           | CONSONANT         | _null_                     | &#x0F40; Ka                  |
| | | | |
|`U+0F7E`   | Mark [Mn]        | BINDU             | TOP_POSITION               | &#x0F7E; Sign Rjes Su Nga Ro |


Codepoints with no assigned meaning are
designated as _unassigned_ in the _Unicode category_ column. 

Assigned codepoints with a _null_ in the _Shaping class_
column evoke no special behavior from the shaping engine.

The _Mark-placement subclass_ column indicates mark-placement
positioning for codepoints in the _Mark_ category. Assigned, non-mark
codepoints have a _null_ in this column and evoke no special
mark-placement behavior. Marks tagged with [Mn] in the _Unicode
category_ column are categorized as non-spacing; marks tagged with
[Mc] are categorized as spacing-combining.

Some codepoints in the tables use a _Shaping class_ that
differs from the codepoint's Unicode _General Category_. The _Shaping
class_ takes precedence during OpenType shaping, as it captures more
specific, script-aware behavior.

Other important characters that may be encountered when shaping runs
of Tibetan text include the dotted-circle placeholder (`U+25CC`), 
the no-break space (`U+00A0`), and the zero-width space (`U+200B`).

The dotted-circle placeholder is frequently used when displaying a
dependent vowel (matra) or a combining mark in isolation. Real-world
text syllables may also use other characters, such as hyphens or dashes,
in a similar placeholder fashion; shaping engines should cope with
this situation gracefully.

<!--- The zero-width joiner is primarily used to prevent the formation of a
subjoining form from a "_Consonant_,Halant,_Consonant_" sequence. The sequence
"_Consonant_,Halant,ZWJ,_Consonant_" blocks the substitution of a
subjoined form for the second consonant. --->

<!---
A secondary usage of the zero-width joiner is to prevent the formation of
"Reph". An initial "Ra,Halant,ZWJ" sequence should not produce a "Reph",
where an initial "Ra,Halant" sequence without the zero-width joiner
otherwise would.
--->

The no-break space is primarily used to insert spaces between
phrases. Tibetan text does not employ inter-word spaces. Consequently,
when spaces are inserted into a text run, it is important that they be
preserved: line-breaking algorithms must not break lines after a
Tibetan space, so the no-break space character is used instead of the
traditional space. 

The no-break space may also be used to display those codepoints that
are defined as non-spacing (marks, dependent vowels (matras),
below-base consonant forms, and post-base consonant forms) in an
isolated context, as an alternative to displaying them superimposed on
the dotted-circle placeholder. 

The Wheel of Dharma symbol (`U+2638`) from the Miscellaneous Symbols
block also occurs in Tibetan texts.


## The `<tibt>` shaping model ##

Processing a run of `<tibt>` text involves three top-level stages:

1. Applying the language substitution features from GSUB
2. Applying all basic substitution features from GSUB
3. Applying all remaining positioning features from GPOS


As with other Brahmi-derived and Indic scripts, the basic substitution
features must be applied to the run in a specific order. The
positioning features in the final stage, however, do not have a
mandatory order.

Unlike many other Brahmi-derived and Indic scripts, shaping Tibetan
text does not require a syllable-identification stage nor any
reordering moves.

A syllable in Tibetan is usually separated from subsequent syllables
or words by a "tsheng" mark at the end of the syllable. A word-final
syllable may also be separated by a punctuation mark or a non-breaking
space.

Each syllable contains exactly one vowel sound. Valid syllables may
begin with either a consonant or an independent vowel. 

The general form of a consonant-based syllable in Tibetan begins with
an optional pre-base consonant (also called a "prefix"), followed by
the syllable's base consonant, zero or more subjoined
consonants, zero or more dependent-vowel signs (matras), an optional
post-base consonant (also called a "suffix") and zero or more syllable
modifiers or diacritical marks.

![Tibetan syllable example](/images/tibetan/tibetan-syllable.png)

The prefix, suffix, and base consonants will all be from the
`CONSONANT` shaping class. All subjoined consonants will be from the
`CONSONANT_SUBJOINED` class.

The prefix, suffix, and base consonant are all shown in
their default form and position. Any subjoined consonants are stacked
below the base consonant. Any dependent vowel signs (matras) are
rendered as marks positioned either above the base consonant or below
the consonant stack.

> Note: A base consonant that is not accompanied by a
> dependent vowel sign (matra) carries the script's inherent vowel
> sound. This vowel sound is changed by a dependent vowel sign
> following the consonant.

> Note: Prefix and suffix consonants do not carry a vowel sound. This
> does not affect shaping, except in that Tibetan differs from many
> other scripts in not employing a "halant" or vowel-killer sign to
> designate the suppression of these sounds.

Certain consonant sequences may take on alternate shapes to provide a
better visual fit with adjoining characters (such as within a
consonant stack). However, these alternates are not considered
orthographically distinct forms.

Native words in Tibetan do not incorporate more than a single
dependent-vowel sign (matra) in a syllable. However, multiple
dependent-vowel signs may be used to represent loanwords from
Sanskrit, Chinese, and many other languages.

In addition to valid syllables, standalone sequences may occur, such
as when an isolated codepoint is shown in example text.

> Note: Foreign loanwords, when written in the Tibetan script, may
> not adhere to the syllable-formation rules described above. 




### 1: Applying the language substitution features from GSUB ###

The language-substitution stage applies mandatory substitution features
using the rules in the font's GSUB table. In preparation for this
stage, glyph sequences should be tagged for possible application 
of GSUB features.

The order in which these substitutions must be performed is fixed:

	locl
	ccmp


#### 1.1 locl ####

The `locl` feature replaces default glyphs with any language-specific
variants, based on examining the language setting of the text run.

> Note: Strictly speaking, the use of localized-form substitutions is
> not part of the shaping process, but of the localization process,
> and could take place at an earlier point while handling the text
> run. However, shaping engines are expected to complete the
> application of the `locl` feature before applying the subsequent
> GSUB substitutions in the following steps.


#### 1.2: ccmp ####

The `ccmp` feature allows a font to substitute mark-and-base sequences
with a pre-composed glyph including the mark and the base, or to
substitute a single glyph into an equivalent decomposed sequence of glyphs. 
 
In `<tibt>` text, this may include decompositions of multi-part
dependent vowel signs (matras).

The Tibetan Unicode block includes several multi-part matras, most
intended for use transcribing Sanskrit. However, usage is discouraged
for several of these matras, and two of the codepoints have been
officially deprecated. In their place, text authors are encouraged to
use the corresponding sequence of single-part matras.

  - `U+0F77` is deprecated and should be replaced by "`U+0FB2`,`U+0F81`"
  - `U+0F79` is deprecated and should be replaced by "`U+0FB3`,`U+0F81`"
  - `U+0F73` can be replaced by "`U+0F71`,`U+0F72`"
  - `U+0F75` can be replaced by "`U+0F71`,`U+0F74`"
  - `U+0F81` can be replaced by "`U+0F71`,`U+0F80`"
  
If present, these composition and decomposition substitutions must be
performed before applying any other GSUB lookups, because
those lookups may be written to match only the `ccmp`-substituted
glyphs. 


![Composition-decomposition substitution](images/tibetan/tibetan-ccmp.png)



### 2: Applying all basic substitution features from GSUB ###

In this stage, the basic substitution features from the GSUB table
are applied. The order in which these features are applied is not
canonical; they should be applied in the order in which they appear in
the GSUB table in the font. 

	abvs
	blws
	calt
	liga


The `abvs` feature replaces above-base-consonant glyphs with special
presentation forms. This usually includes contextual variants of
above-base marks or contextually appropriate mark-and-base ligatures.

![Application of the abvs feature](/images/tibetan/tibetan-abvs.png)


The `blws` feature replaces below-base-consonant glyphs with special
presentation forms. In Tibetan, this can include contextual ligatures
involving below-base dependent vowel marks (matras) or subjoined
consonants.

![Application of the blws feature](/images/tibetan/tibetan-blws.png)


The `calt`  feature substitutes glyphs with contextual alternate
forms. In general, this involves replacing the default form of a
stacking glyph (such as a subjoined consonant) with an alternate that
provides a preferable connection to an adjacent glyph in the stack.

The `calt` feature performs substitutions that are not mandatory for
orthographic correctness. The substitutions made by `calt`
can be disabled by application-level user interfaces.

![Application of the calt feature](/images/tibetan/tibetan-calt.png)



The `liga` feature substitutes standard, optional ligatures that are on
by default. Substitutions made by `liga` may be disabled by
application-level user interfaces.

![Application of the liga feature](/images/tibetan/tibetan-liga.png)



### 3: Applying remaining positioning features from GPOS ###

In this stage, mark positioning, kerning, and other GPOS features are
applied. As with the preceding stage, the order in which these
features are applied is not canonical; they should be applied in the
order in which they appear in the GPOS table in the font.

        kern
		abvm
        blwm
		mkmk

> Note: The `kern` feature is usually applied at this stage, if it is
> present in the font. However, `kern` is not mandatory for shaping
> Tibetan text and may be disabled by user preference.

The `kern` feature adjusts the horizontal positioning of
glyphs.

![Application of the kern feature](/images/tibetan/tibetan-kern.png)


The `abvm` feature positions above-base glyphs for attachment to base
characters. In Tibetan, this includes tone markers, diacritical marks,
and above-base dependent vowels (matras).

![Application of the abvm feature](/images/tibetan/tibetan-abvm.png)

The `blwm` feature positions below-base glyphs for attachment to base
characters. In Tibetan, this includes subjoined consonants as well as
below-base dependent vowels (matras), and diacritical marks.

![Application of the blwm feature](/images/tibetan/tibetan-blwm.png)


The `mkmk` feature positions marks with respect to preceding marks,
providing proper positioning for sequences of marks that attach to the
same base glyph. In Tibetan, this also includes attaching marks to
subjoined consonants or dependent vowels.

![Application of the mkmk feature](/images/tibetan/tibetan-mkmk.png)
