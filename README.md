At present, we are seeking comments and bugfixes on the Indic-script,
Arabic-like, Hangul, Hebrew, Thai/Lao, Tibetan, Khmer, Myanmar,
default, and USE documents. Interested readers and contributors can
begin at the

  - [Indic General](opentype-shaping-indic-general.md) 
    - (Devanagari, Bengali, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam,
      Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Sinhala) 
  - [Arabic General](opentype-shaping-arabic-general.md)
    - (Arabic, N'Ko, Syriac, Mongolian)
  - [Hangul](opentype-shaping-hangul.md)
  - [Hebrew](opentype-shaping-hebrew.md)
  - [Khmer](opentype-shaping-khmer.md)
  - [Thai and Lao](opentype-shaping-thai-lao.md)
  - [Tibetan](opentype-shaping-tibetan.md)
  - [Myanmar](opentype-shaping-myanmar.md)
  - [Universal Shaping Engine (USE)](opentype-shaping-use.md)
    - All complex scripts that are not handled by a dedicated
      script-specific shaping model
  - [Default](opentype-shaping-default.md)
    - All non-complex scripts
  - [Emoji](opentype-shaping-emoji.md)
    - Emoji sequences do not constitute a separate shaping model,
      but handling emoji sequences can incorporate many of the same
      Opentype mechanisms and should not be overlooked
  
shaping documents and are encouraged to submit their feedback
on the text or images of any of the linked scripts.  The documents are
organized by script; where there are multiple shaping models for a
particular script (including deprecated models), the various models are
all addressed in the same script-specific document.

The documents also include a description of
[normalization](opentype-shaping-normalization.md) in the OpenType
shaping context, which differs from Unicode normalization in several
respects.

Various [notes](notes/README.md) about the document set and the details
of its scope, limitations, and quirks are also provided.

Some [errata](errata.md) about the "upstream" specifications and
reference documents are noted separately.

In its final form, this repository will hold documentation describing
the shaping behavior used for layout of OpenType text. In particular,
it will focus on complex scripts.

In addition to the primary, per-script documents, implementers and
other interesteed readers are encouraged to check the
[character tables](character-tables/README.md) for correctness and to
examine the [image-generation logs](/images/README.md) to identify
issues seen in the inline images.

   found via [HarfBuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz), because
   HarfBuzz intentionally aims to produce results that will 100% match
   the output of Microsoft Uniscribe (not counting cases where
   Uniscribe's output is known to be incorrect, of course).
