"""The sequence of #RRGGBB colors used in the colorized SVG illustration images.
"""

# Defines the color sequence used to colorize clusters in the SVG illustration
# images.
#
# It is based on the G10 sequence employed by Plotly, as visible at:
# https://plotly.com/python/discrete-color/#color-sequences-in-plotly-express
#
# This sequence is chosen because it is generally consistent in value and it
# does not include any greys.
